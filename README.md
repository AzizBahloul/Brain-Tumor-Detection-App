Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning üß†
Welcome to the Brain Tumor Detection project, a cutting-edge deep learning application designed to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans with high accuracy. Powered by a modified VGG16 convolutional neural network (CNN), this tool classifies brain scans into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary Tumor, and No Tumor. This repository provides a robust, user-friendly solution for medical image analysis, complete with a Streamlit-based web interface for seamless interaction.

User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for easy image uploads and result visualization.
Comprehensive Analysis: Displays prediction probabilities and detailed reports.
Real-Time Processing: Processes MRI scans in real time for immediate results.
Open Source: Licensed under the MIT License for community collaboration.


üöÄ Features

Advanced CNN Architecture: Built on VGG16 with custom layers for enhanced performance.
Real-Time Classification: Processes MRI scans instantly for quick diagnosis.
Probability Visualization: Displays confidence scores for each tumor category.
Web Interface: Intuitive Streamlit app for uploading and analyzing images.
Detailed Reports: Generates comprehensive analysis for each prediction.
Scalable Design: Easily adaptable for other medical imaging tasks.
