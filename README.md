# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This repository contains a deep learning application for detecting and classifying brain tumors from MRI scans. The system utilizes state-of-the-art convolutional neural networks to provide accurate classifications across four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and normal (no tumor) cases.

### Features
- Advanced CNN architecture based on VGG16 with custom modifications
- Real-time image processing and classification
- Comprehensive visualization of prediction probabilities
- User-friendly web interface built with Streamlit
- High-accuracy tumor detection and classification
- Detailed analysis reports for each prediction

## Technical Architecture

### Model Architecture
- Base: VGG16 (pretrained on ImageNet)
- Additional layers:
  - Global Average Pooling 2D
  - Dense layer (1024 units, ReLU activation)
  - Dropout layer (0.5)
  - Dense layer (512 units, ReLU activation)
  - Output layer (4 units, Softmax activation)

### Dependencies
```
numpy
pandas
tensorflow
keras
streamlit
opencv-python
pillow
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended for training)
- 8GB RAM minimum
- 50GB free disk space

### Installation Steps
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-detection.git
cd brain-tumor-detection
```

2. Create and activate virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
```

3. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```



## Usage

### Running the Application
1. Start the Streamlit server:
```bash
streamlit run app/main.py
```

2. Access the application at `http://localhost:8501`

3. Upload an MRI scan image through the web interface

4. View the classification results and probability distribution

### API Usage
```python
from app.preprocessing import preprocess_image
from models.model import BrainTumorModel

# Initialize model
model = BrainTumorModel()
model.load_weights('models/weights/brain_tumor_model.keras')

# Preprocess image
image = preprocess_image('path/to/image.jpg')

# Get prediction
prediction = model.predict(image)
```

## Model Training
